# interpretable-GNNs
Implementation of The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Networks with DGL.

## Addition
I have added a feature-dependent distance transformation function.

## Help
It's slow. Can you make it faster and check the correctness of the code? I have made the discussion open; you can ask questions there.

## Requirements
To install DGL, use the following command: `pip install dgl -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/torch-2.4/repo.html`.  
PyTorch should be version 2.4.  
To install scikit-learn, use `pip install scikit-learn`.

## requirements.txt
The `requirements.txt` file contains all the dependencies needed to run this project. To install the dependencies, use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: This setup is for CPU only.
